# TDD_Server

## Overview 
This is a simple back-end server that was coded using TDD. The goal of this project is to practice creating a server with API routes that perform CRUD operations on JSON data file.

## Building
npm install

## Testing
npm test

## Starting
npm start

## Tech Stack & Dependencies 
- Express.js for back-end server 
- Jest for JS test runner
- Supertest, an HTTP assertions library, for API test cases
- HTTP-errors for creating HTTP errors 

## Reflections
Overall, this was a smoothe project to complete. I have only worked with Mocha/Chai before. It was relatively easy to work with Jest & Supertest. However, I would like to also try to write the test cases using Mocha/Chai in order to compare the difference in the TDD process.
